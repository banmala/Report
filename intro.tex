		\normalsize
		Visually impaired people struggle a lot in their life, being unable to see clearly is a major disorder for keeping their life in balance.Thus, for assisting those people in their daily life, we've decided to make a portable system that can be easily accessible to all visually impaired people through their mobile phones. In this system ,we'll detect the surrounding objects as from the user's camera utility and recognize those objects then, provide guidance about the objects to user with commanding speech.
