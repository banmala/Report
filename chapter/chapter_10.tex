        \chapter{Conclusion and Future Enhancements}
        In conclusion, Iteration 1 for the project Voice Assistance for the visually impaired people is completed as we succesfully deployed the project as a desktop application.\\
        As for Future Ehancements for our project we could implement these:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Generating our own models using custom dataset.
                \item A finer classification like for example: people could be subclassed into walking, running, sitting, eating, talking on the phone, jumping, lying on the ground etc.
                \item Any objects that may of interest to the user like statues, monuments etc. 
                \item Natural speaker can be assigned to TTS module as native speakers may have calm and good supportive accents.
                \item Use of image captioning or labeling for much more detailed information about surroundings.
        \end{itemize}
