                \item Google Drive
                \item Google Calender
            \end{enumerate}
         \section{Hardware Requirement}
            Our prepared system of virtual assistant requires following hardware requirements:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Android Mobile for video capturing.
                \item Desktop with NVIDIA Graphics Card (11 GB,RTX 2080 Ti)  and 16 GB RAM.
            \end{enumerate}
            
        \section{Functional Requirement}
            The functional requirement for the prepared systems are:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The system must be able to capture image/video in real time.
                \item It must instruct visually impaired people in real time.
                \item It must not disturb and produce unwanted commands instructions.
            \end{enumerate}

        \section{Non-Functional Requirement}
            These are essential for the better performance of the system. The points below focus on the non-functional requirement of the system prepared. 
            \subsection{Reliability }
                Different test metrices must be conducted to test the accuracy of the system.
            \subsection{Maintainability} 
                The System is breakdown into multiple sub module so that we could know where the problem is and maintain the sub module. 
            \subsection{Performance}
                The object detection and only single process is required. So, it will be able to provide better performance.
            \subsection{Frame Per Sec}
                For the smoothnesss of the system, we required at least 4 to 7 frame per sec.
