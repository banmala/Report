        \section{Background Introduction}
            People are facing problems in their daily life. They are facing problem to reach their destination because of traffic, obstacle and many more.But, in our society there are visually impaired people as well. These people find it difficult to even complete their daily routine. Even, the simple job like playing, walking, moving becomes more difficult for these people. The physically challenged people may be visually impaired people, deaf. There may be people who have diseases like polio, Parkinson's, Amputee Cancer. Among them, blind people face a lot problem. They cannot see the beautiful world. They have lost the opportunity to live a happy life with the nature. They cannot enjoy with the beauty of the earth. Besides, it's very difficult for them to travel from one place to another on their own. Some people use white cane for their help. It may provide some relief, some direction to them. But, They want some one who can help them, instruct them to reach their destination. \\
            \\
            So, here we have come with an instructor to instruct those blind people. We are here with the system that will instruct a blind or visually impaired people with the current state environment. \\
            \\
            In this project, we use object detection method, detect and recognize the object and give audio/vocal information about it.

        \section{Motivation}
            There is no doubt that the world for visually impaired people is difficult to live than normal people. Visually impaired people find it difficult to do their regular activities like finding materials, getting things on their own, arranging clothes, cooking, etc. But, The biggest challenge for a blind person, especially the one with the complete loss of vision, is to navigate around places. Obviously, blind people roam relatively easily around their house without any help because they know the position of everything in the house. But, it is not possible while going out where visually impaired people havenâ€™t been before. \\
            Thus, our system provides Voice Assistant for guiding and instructing blind people and visually impaired people so that they can navigate around places by themselves. 
            
        \section{Problem Definition}
          Blind people face several problems in their daily life. They lack their vision totally or partially due to neurological or physiological factors. In recent years, blind mobility has become an important issue since a large number of people are visually impaired and partially sighted. Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. This 1 billion people includes those with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness due to unaddressed refractive error, as well as near vision impairment caused by unaddressed presbyopia. Globally, the leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts. The majority of people with vision impairment are over the age of 50 years. Navigation for visually impaired person is a great challenge as these people has to rely on other. The simplest and most widely used travelling aid used by all blinds is the white cane. It has provided those people with a better way to reach destination and detect obstacles on ground, but it cannot give them a high guarantee to protect themselves from all level of obstacles. Sometimes it happens that blind people are lost and their guardians get tensed about them. There have been many efforts but even now, it is not easy for the blind people to move. To solve this great problem it has been studied by many researches about support instruments for eye-sight. According to the problems stated earlier we have prepared a system in this paper which aid blind person by informing about the obstacles around them which help them to move around without the help of other.

        \section{Goals and Objectives}
            The main objective of this project is:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item To instruct the visually impaired people using voice assistant.
            \end{itemize}
        \section{Scope and Applications}
        The major scope of the project is to assist visually impaired people and the system is able to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item be used by visually impaired people worldwide.
            \item provide a voice assistance for guiding and instructing Visually Impaired People.
        \end{itemize}
        \section{Report Organization}
            \subsection{Introduction}
                The main purpose of the introduction is to set the scene for our readers so that they can know about the problems that visually impaired people have to go through and how our purposed system can help them. 
            \subsection{Literature Review}
                The literature review is there to familiarize ourselves with the current state of knowledge on assistance for visually impaired people and ensure us to not repeat what others have already done. 
            \subsection{Feasibility Study}
                It is used to determine the viability of an idea, such as ensuring our project is legally and technically feasible as well as economically justifiable or not. 
            \subsection{Methodology}
                It critically helps us to analyze and select correct method for our project to avoid unnecessary hurdles. 
            \subsection{Requirement Analysis}
                It gives us a clear vision about the necessary programming languages and software required to build voice assistance. 
            \subsection{System Design and Architecture}
                The main purpose of this is to evaluate the contribution of each component for overall performance of the system using different diagrams. 
            \subsection{Block Diagram and Description of Proposed System}
                It provides us quick and high-level view of different topics which enhances our ability to understand that topic.
            \subsection{Expected Outcome}
                It helps to ensure that our set goal is achieved and not to repeat what others have done already in this topic. 
            \subsection{Actual Outcome}
                It provides clear view about the accomplishments we have achieved and comparison can be made with expected outcome to note down deviations.
            \subsection{Conclusion and Future enhancements}
                The conclusion section summarizes our main thoughts on project and future enhancements provides us scope to upgrade our project.
